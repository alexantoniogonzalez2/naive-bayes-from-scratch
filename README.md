## Naïve Bayes
In this project was developed a Naïve Bayes model from scratch, this is, avoiding to use the built in methods from libraries like Keras or Scikit-learn. The purpose of this restriction is getting a deeper understanding of the mathematical background of the the Naïve Bayes model. Specifically, the model for the prediction of academic grades.

### Files
- The model is available in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/alexantoniogonzalez2/naive-bayes-from-scratch/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20from%20scratch.ipynb).
- For comparison purposes, a short equivalent version of the model(using Scikit-learn this time) is available [here](https://github.com/alexantoniogonzalez2/naive-bayes-from-scratch/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes%20with%20Scikit-learn.ipynb).

### Requirements
- Environment for run a Jupyter Notebook. For example: [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/install). A basic requirement for Jupyter Notebook is Python.   
- The data files utilized in this project should be in a folder named 'data' in the same directory that the file 'Naive Bayes from scratch.ipynb'.


### Compatibility
The libraries needed in this project are specified in the Jupyter Notebook. The most general libraries utilized are:
- Python: 3.7.5
- Scikit-learn: 0.22


### Context
This works is part of the subject COMP90049 Introduction to Machine Learning, 2020 Semester 1, The University of Melbourne.
